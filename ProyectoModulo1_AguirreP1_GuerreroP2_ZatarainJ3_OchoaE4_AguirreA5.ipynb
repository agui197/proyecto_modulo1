    "* Make an exploratory analysis to describe each cluster from the accepted loans data set with emphasis on the way different loan grades are distributed among clusters\n",
    "* Describe the relationships between interest rates, profit, default rate and grade, and calculate the profitability of the portfolio for the accepted loans data set.\n",

    "## 1.2 Problem's Definition\n",
    "The company * Kueski * is an online platform that facilitates the obtenition of short-term loans. The company has to grant loans to people, however these people must fulfill certain requirements to be given the loan. The platform works as follows:\n",
    "1. The amount and term of the required loan must be indicated, with which the online application will show the amount to be paid at maturity.\n",
    "2. Personal information and bank accounts are requested.\n",
    "3. The characteristics of the candidate are analyzed and the loan application is accepted or rejected.\n",
    "4. If accepted, the creditor must pay the loan as well as its interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is appreciated that compared to a traditional loan, this platform makes it easier for the user to obtain them, since they are instantaneous and via Internet. This advantage to the user aims at a much greater risk for the institution that grants the loan, since the user profile is not observed in a meticulous way, and therefore there is a greater risk that the debtor will default on its payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of credit risk it is important to distinguish the characteristics of the users that will pay in loan in the given term, and those of the users who will not comply with the payment. For this, it is important to generate a model that classifies users under these characteristics, determining whether or not they will comply with the loan payment. Also, is important to generate a model that classifies the users which application was accepted to determine if some characteristics of the user know at the time of the application are related with the loan grades. The results od these models could give * Kueski * a more efficient way to evaluate loan applications and reduce the credit risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in order to improve the profits of the company and give them a more statistical risk-reward strategy, a model could assign a *fair* insterest rate to the loan grade profile of the user that maximices the profit.\n",
    "\n",
